Got the willing and the data but don't know how to run your first data science project? 

One of our key offerings is to be a guiding hand through your first project(s) -- Steph will work with you to design an architecture, map out the process, and mentor your team through the project. This can be as light touch as providing a rough plan, or as intensive as daily mentoring and development.

The level of engagement is up to you but this is a great way to parachute in an expert to help you get started but leave your team with the skills needed to do the next project.
