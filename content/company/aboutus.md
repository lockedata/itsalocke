> Locke Data helps organisations start doing data science.

We're a new data science consultancy founded by [Steph Locke](#) early in 2017. Our focus is on starting data science successfully. 

We don't specialise in AI and we'll rarely recommend things like convolutional neural networks or try to use the latest deep learning framework.

Our experience has been that most people need something simpler.

People need to get their data right, they need to work out how to get stuff into production, and they need to work on implementing the 20% of the possible models that'll deliver 80% of the value.

This is where we come in.

We help people **start** doing data science. We get them over the initial hurdles by helping them get ready and do their few projects.

We don't take some data from people, go do some wizardry, and come back with some black-box model. We work with your staff to get the data, bring them along as we build a model, work with stakeholders to ensure the model makes sense, and then we work with your developers to put it live.

We're here to help build up your team and your skills.
