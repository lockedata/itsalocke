Here at Locke Data, we love our technology communities. The more we can share and do for others the better.

Here are some of the way we contribute and how you can take advantage of them.

## Presenting at meetups
We will happily present at your meetup or user group.

It might have to be remote and it will definitely have to fit into our schedule -- but we will do a talk for you!

You can see past [talks](//lockelife.com/talks) to get an idea of what topics are available. Did you know that some have videos attached you can use in an emergency?

## Grow your meetup's funds
If your meetup is UK based and you'd like to raise some funds, Locke Data can run a half day workshop with you.

You secure the venue and publicise the event, we provide the trainer for the afternoon and handle registrations. All funds go to you after we've covered any travel & expenses.

Here are the half day courses you can get us to deliver:

- Logistic regressions in R
- Modern statistics in R
- Reusable code in R
- Data manipulation in R
- Building dashboard with shiny
