Locke Data was founded by Steph Locke.

Steph has worked in many industries including insurance, finance, and security. 

She’s built models suggesting insurance cross-sells, predicting who’ll stop paying loans, and identifying unusual web traffic.

Steph has founded numerous local, national, and global data communities.

Steph speaks and teaches extensively around the world. She recently calculated that in her spare time she'd helped more than 5,000 people solve data or data science challenges.

Microsoft awarded Steph the Most Valued Professional for their Data Platform. One of fewer than 500 MVPs for the Data Platform globally, Microsoft recognise her influence and expertise.
