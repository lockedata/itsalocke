> You donâ€™t build a business. You build people, and people build the business.

Data science is a team sport and needs many people in your organisation to have the required skills. Investing in training your existing staff helps ensure you can get the necessary skillsets whilst being able to build better data products as your people know your organisation and its data.

If one of our [bundles](../recommendtraining) doesn't fit the bill for what you need, we can develop a custom training solution based off our existing training and extend it into specific areas you need covered or use your organisation's data to ensure people get practice working with their data.

## Picking the custom content
We offer training in the core competencies of data science. You can pick and choose days of training that build up skills to a given level in a day.

### Levels
We try to offer these using levels so that the higher up the levels you go, the more prior knowledge and experience is expected. 

- The Foundation level teaches a the pre-requisite skills to be able to perform tasks in this area. This is usually a good fit for people who might be cross-training from a non-technical background and need additional concepts they might not yet have gained. It's also good for people who want to understand the technology but won't necessarily use the skills.
- The Beginner level is for people who have some technical experience and are looking to acquire start skills in the area or might only use the skills irregularly.
- The Intermediate level is for people who have already started building their skills and who are likely to use the skill most days.
- The Advanced level is great for people who will sue this skill day to day and find themselves dealing with sophisticated challenges.
- The Executive level isn't aimed at teaching the skills and instead focuses on the high level process, technology, and managing people who perform this task.

By using levels that take a day, it becomes much easier to build a course that suits your specific needs, at the level you need, and that lasts an easy to calculate duration.

### Further customisation
If blending existing training isn't quite right, you can even customise further still.

- Get training that incorporates your organisation's data
- Get training on topics we haven't previously offered
- Build training at the module (~2.5hours) level, if required
