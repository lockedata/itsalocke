Our online training events allow you to get training from the comfort of your own armchair or office chair. As well as the training, we give you a bunch of stuff:

- Access to our Slack environment for on the day and you can use it to get support for a month after the training
- Access to our lab environments and you'll be able to work through the labs again after the event
- Handouts that you'll be able to access forever
- A Kindle copy of a relevant book
