## Decide your requirements

- How much access should we have to your systems?
    + **None** If you only need general advice or want to just show via screenshare then we don't need to do any setup
	+ **Exports** If want to be able to send us data and we need to spend some time discussing storage, retention etc
	+ **Remoting & logins** If you want us to be able to login to your systems to be able to do stuff
- How often will you need us?
    + **Just the once** For something that comes up out of the blue
    + **Occasionally** For just one or two things a month
	+ **Often** For things that come up weekly - maybe a small team who knows their stuff or one person who needs support
	+ **A lot** For on-tap support for a team learning their craft
- What turnaround time do you need? 
    + **It can wait!** For emails or calls that can be scheduled later in the week or early next week
	+ **Need it soon** For emails or calls actioned same day or the next
	+ **Need it now** For same day responses
	
## Pricing up

### Setup costs
Depending on how much access you need us to have, we'll need to spend some time doing initial setup work with you. 

| Level         | Cost |
|---------------|-----:|
| No access     | £0   |
| Exports       | £250 |
| Remote access | £500 |

### Usage
Pick your expected amount of utilisation to determine the monthly cost under the **It can wait!** turnaround times.

| Level           | Hours included |   Cost | Extra hours |
|-----------------|---------------:|-------:|------------:|
| Out of the blue |              0 |     £0 |        £250 |
| Occasional use  |              2 |   £400 |        £200 |

| A lot           |             10 | £1,500 |        £150 |

### Urgency
We're a jetsetting bunch with clients all over the place so flexibility is great for us. The sooner you need us, the less flexible we can be overall so there's a premium associated with how quickly you need us to turnaround answers of jump on calls with you, especially if you're outside of core timezones as it means we have to stay up late.

| Urgency      | GMT∓4  | Rest of world |
|--------------|-------:|--------------:|
| It can wait  |   1.0x |          1.0x |
| Need it soon |   1.1x |          1.2x |
| Need it now  |   1.3x |          1.5x |

This means:

- if you are in the UK, intend to reach out to us often, and want next day business turnaround then the monthly cost will be £880 plus setup
- if you are in the US and want same day turnaround on a lot of help, the monthly cost will be £2,250 plus setup
