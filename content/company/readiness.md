> Is your organisation ready to start doing data science?

Before we setup Locke Data, we saw plenty of data science initiatives happen. Some failed, some succeeded. Our focus is on helping folks get into the "succeeded" bucket. 

One of the best ways we've found to help that happen is to work with organisations *before* they start their initiative and working out whether they should start, or if there's some things they need to sort out first.


> Fail to plan, and you plan to fail

Our Readiness Reviews involves going through our checklist to assess different criteria around people, processes, and tools. We blend quantitative components like skills tests for staff to qualitiative reviews of documentation and compiling feedback from interviews.

Once we've checked out where you are, we'll then be able to provide recommendations. 

Hopefully, you're ready or just have some minor things to solve. Getting the green light from an independent, experienced third party is a great way to start with buy-in from within your organisation. 

If on the other hand, we identify some critical blockers and recommend you solve those first, then the review could save you trying to get data science going in your organisation and wasting plenty of time and money along the way.
