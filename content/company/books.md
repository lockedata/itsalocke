It doesn't have to all be MOOCs and videos these days for learning. There's still a place for a good book! We're building up a series of books that help people learn the fundamentals of R.

## Working with R
[Working with R](//geni.us/workingwithr) is the first book in the R Fundamentals series. The book introduces you to the core concepts of R and helps you be effective as soon as you start. It is the first in a series of books that will help you use R to achieve awesome things in your day job.

> I wish this book had been available when I started learning R!
