Whether you just need a second set of eyes on your work, or something more official, we can help. 

If you're a small team or a team of one, it can be really tough to get someone to check your work. How do you know you're right? Steph's been there and her solution was to get someone from outside the organisation to come in and do a review. Now we offers these reviews too!

A peer review involves spending some time describing to us the problem and the approach taken to solve it. We'll then review the code and documentation associated with the solution or model. We then compile a report outlining our findings for you.

A formal audit involves a more extensive process that also includes data verification, and assessing reproducibility. The report includes all findings and is much more extensive as it is designed for consumption by regulators or third parties who might not have the same level of domain or technical knowledge.
