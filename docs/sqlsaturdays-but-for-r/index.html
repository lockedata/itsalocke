      <p><strong>UPDATE: Proposal now being developed after fantastic community support. Check out satRdays on <a href="https://github.com/stephlocke/RSaturday-proposal">GitHub</a> and contribute your opinions!</strong></p>

<p>I had a contact from a very nice chap in Dallas a month ago about whether in the R world we do anything like SQLSaturdays.</p>

<p>The great thing about the SQLSaturdays he said was not that they&#8217;re free (well it helps!) but that they&#8217;re on his time. Developing his skills was something he couldn&#8217;t get signed off by his boss so he wanted to be able to do it by himself.</p>

<p>In answer to the question of whether there are local(ish) weekend conferences happening regularly for R, my answer was &#8220;not really&#8221; and it&#8217;s a shame because the R community is fantastic. I started thinking about why we don&#8217;t have them and what would be needed to change that.</p>

<p>Free / cheap regional small-medium conferences are a must for growing user knowledge and speakers in R.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="what-are-sqlsaturdays">What are SQLSaturdays?</h2>

<p>SQLSaturdays are free, SQL Server related conferences held around the world. The SQLSaturdays focus on developing technical knowledge and skill with talks at a range of levels. The first SQLSaturday was in 2007, and in 2015 it&#8217;ll have grown to 115 events across the globe. That&#8217;s a fantastic achievement, especially as we&#8217;re generally seeing the SQL events expand into Business Intelligence and Analytics.</p>

<p>They&#8217;re run by local communities to grow support and attendance for their user groups, but they&#8217;re supported globally by <a href="http://sqlpass.org/">PASS</a> who provide the brand, the amazingly helpful <a href="https://twitter.com/KarlaKay22">Karla</a>, and the digital infrastructure needed.</p>

<h2 id="who-are-pass">Who are PASS?</h2>

<p>PASS was set up in 1999 by Microsoft and CA Technologies to help promote and educate users of SQL Server around the world. PASS run the PASS Summit, a much larger paid-for conference that acts as a fund-raising vehicle for the support of PASS&#8217; infrastructure, SQLSaturdays, and the Virtual Chapters. The way PASS operate the events to help grow the user base and the quality of knowledge within the SQL community, provide a great example that the new <a href="https://www.r-consortium.org/">R Consortium</a> could learn from &#8211; especially given Microsoft are key partners of the group. PASS operate with some salaried employees but for the most part this massive organisation is staffed with volunteers &#8211; it&#8217;s not perfect but they do a great of supporting learning and the community.</p>

<h2 id="what-8217-s-the-problem-for-doing-them-for-r">What&#8217;s the problem for doing them for R?</h2>

<p>If they&#8217;re so awesome, why aren&#8217;t we already doing them? There are a few main reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>There&#8217;s been not been a central association / organisation with this in their remit</li>
<li>The user base for R is much smaller than SQL Server was, even back in 2007, let alone today</li>
<li>A corollary of fewer users is that there are fewer speakers. This makes it harder to get 5 to 10 good quality speakers for a conference in Cardiff or Albuquerque for instance</li>
<li>The academic roots of R means that almost R conferences happen during the week* and potentially there could be a lot of pushback to weekend events</li>
<li>There may not be enough companies deriving benefits from the R language and who are willing to pay to grow the user base and brand awareness</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-it-would-take-to-get-them-going-for-r">What it would take to get them going for R?</h2>

<p>In terms of what it would take to do these, the answer is &#8220;not much&#8221;. Doing a minimal replication would entail:</p>

<ol>
<li>A group of people who can produce a central platform</li>
<li>Some pilot user groups out there willing to organise a conference</li>
<li>A few good sponsors who can support the first conferences</li>
<li>A group of people willing to travel to speak and/or attend</li>
<li>A dab hand at graphic design to come up with a neat logo</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-next">What next?</h2>

<p>I think R Saturdays could be a great way to make R more accessible. Community events don&#8217;t happen because of just one person though, it can literally be a cast of thousands when you include the attendees, so more folks are required to make it happen &#8211; so we&#8217;ll need some willing people to help tackle this.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s theoretically within the remit of the <a href="https://www.r-consortium.org/news/faqs/what-kinds-projects-will-r-consortium-undertake">R Consortium to provide a central platform for these events</a>. It&#8217;d additionally support the big useR! conferences too, so this could be an excellent proposal to put in front in of the Infrastructure Committee. I raised it at the Panel Discussion at <a href="http://www.earl-conference.com/boston/agenda/">EARL 2015 Boston</a> and the Consortium are keen.</p>

<p>I intend to submit a proposal, but before I do, I&#8217;d really love to have some discussion on the concept and potential pitfalls people might see. Please either discuss below or <a href="https://twitter.com/home?status=Hey%20%40SteffLocke,%20about%20%23RSaturdays">tweet with #RSaturday to @SteffLocke</a>.</p>
